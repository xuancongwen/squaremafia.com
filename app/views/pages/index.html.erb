        <h2><strong>We</strong> are the <strong>Square Mafia</strong>...</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          A community of former Square employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're engineers, supporters,
          designers, product managers, and more. Our paths diverged with Square, but
          our connections to each other live on.
        </p>

        <h3>What we do <strong>today</strong></h3>
        <p>
          We provide <strong>mailing lists</strong>, a <strong>slack group</strong>, and a <strong>directory</strong> to
          help our members keep in touch. We have also been known to organize the occasional <strong>happy hour</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>What we will do <strong>in the future</strong></h3>
        <p>
          That's for you to decide! Right now we just facilitate the conversation.
